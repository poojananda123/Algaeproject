    <h6>

Also called Rhodophyta, it is a distinctive species found in marine as well as freshwater ecosystems. The pigments phycocyanin and phycoerythrin are responsible for the characteristic red colouration of the algae. Other pigments that provide green colouration (such as chlorophyll a) are present. However, they lack chlorophyll b or beta-carotene.
    </h6>
    <h4 class="bg-danger text-white">Uses : </h4>
    <p>
      Red algae are used as the source of food for thousands of years as they are high in vitamins, minerals, a rich source of calcium, magnesium, and antioxidants. They are sources of dietary fibre as they have the ability to promote healthy circulation, lower bad cholesterol and regulate blood sugar levels.

    <h1 class="bg-success text-white">Blue-Green Algae</h1>
<h6>
  In the past, blue-green algae were one of the most well-known types of algae. However, since blue-green algae are prokaryotes, they are not currently included under algae (because all algae are classified as eukaryotic organisms).
Also called cyanobacteria, these organisms live in moist or aquatic environments just like other algae. These include dams, rivers, reservoirs, creeks, lakes and oceans. This class of bacteria obtains energy through the process of photosynthesis. Ecologically, some species of blue-green algae are significant to the environment as it fixes the nitrogen in the soil. Hence, these are also called nitrogen-fixing bacteria. E.g. Nostoc, Anabaena, etc.

<h4 class="bg-success text-white">Uses : </h4>
<p>
  blue-green algae are used for treating high blood pressure and as a protein supplement. It's also used for high levels of cholesterol or other fats (lipids) in the blood, diabetes, obesity, and many other conditions.
